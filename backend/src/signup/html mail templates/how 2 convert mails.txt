export als html
dann das machen:

Ran into this issue recently while trying to use custom HTML in the CustomMessage trigger. For me, the problem turned out to be Unicode U+00A0 (No-Break Space).

I did not need to URL encode the HTML. Stripping this character from the html resolved the error.
html = html.replace(/\u00A0/g, '');

I used the MJML demo page to generate my email HTML, so am not sure why this particular character is generated for some templates and not others.

Hopefully, this helps others googling this issue.
